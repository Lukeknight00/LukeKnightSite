title: About Me, Luke Knight!
---
I have lived my life between three countries, each on their own continents. Cape Town, South Africa; London, England; and California, USA are all places I consider home. The fact that I grew up a part of these three melting pots had a significant impact on who I am today. 


I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona in December of 2020, earning a bachelors of science in computer information systems with a focus in application development. My goal is to manage teams developing software and CPP gave me  hands on experiences doing just that.
