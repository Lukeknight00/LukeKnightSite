title: About Me, Luke Knight!
---
I have lived my life between three countries, each on their own continents. Cape Town, South Africa; London, England; and California, USA are all places I consider home. The fact that I grew up a part of these three melting pots had a significant impact on who I am today. 
 
I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona in December of 2020, earning a bachelors of science in computer information systems with a focus in application development. My goal is to manage teams developing software and CPP gave me  hands-on experiences doing just that.
 
 
#My Software Development Journey
![](../img/scratch.png 'scratch')
The first experience I had with software engineering was when I was around 10 or so and built simple games in Scratch, a visual scripting language that serves as a great introduction to higher level logic.

####Mountain View High School
The next major milestone was taking Computer Science AP at Mountain View High School, as well as being on the robotics team. Both taught me Java in different ways, and gave me a great depth of understanding in object oriented programming.

####Cal Poly Pomona
My education at Cal Poly Pomona started to round out my software development experience. I took classes, like discrete mathematics, which fundamentally changed how I look at problems. I furthered my object oriented programming experience through Java and C++. I  started to learn more about web and mobile based applications near the end of my college career, starting to become proficient in HTML, JavaScript, SQL, ASP.net and the MVC (model-view-controller) pattern. I also built a fundamental understanding on the development of secure web applications, and e-commerce applications.

####Post Graduation
Once I graduated, I focused on learning some modern frameworks. After working up a basic understanding of Angular, entity framework, and a couple of other newer frameworks, I focused on becoming proficient with 3 things. Gatsby.JS a react based static site generator. GraphQl, the query language/framework used by gatsby to deliver content. And Netlify CMS, a content management system for my git workflow, that also serves this website!

###Coding for fun
As a way to further hone my coding skills, as well as to just have fun, I have started creative coding and game development projects in my down time. By using P5.js, a javascript processing library, I have been learning more complex javascript. With Unreal Engine I have been learning more C++, as well as visual scripting.
