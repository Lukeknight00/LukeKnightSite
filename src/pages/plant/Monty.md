  The plant may be confused with *[Thaumatophyllum bipinnatifidum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaumatophyllum_bipinnatifidum "Thaumatophyllum bipinnatifidum")*, known as the Split-leaf Philodendron or Tree Philodendron, as they have similar leaves and growing habits. <!--StartFragment-->


  This member of the [arum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arum "Arum") [family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology) "Family (biology)") [Araceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Araceae "Araceae") is an [epiphyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphyte "Epiphyte") with [aerial roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_roots "Aerial roots"), able to grow up to 20 m (66 ft) high in the wild, with large, leathery, glossy, heart-shaped leaves 25–90 cm (10–35.5 in) long by 25–75 cm (10–29.5 in) broad. The leaves on young plants are smaller and entire with no lobes or holes, but soon produce lobed and [fenestrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_shape "Leaf shape") leaves as they grow.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstera_deliciosa#cite_note-7) Although it can grow very tall in nature, it only measures between 2 and 3 m (6.6 and 9.8 ft) when grown indoors. The leaves are large (up to 1 m or 3.3 ft long), heart-shaped and pinnate. The older the plant, the more the leaves are covered with its familiar large perforations.


  Wild seedlings grow towards the darkest area they can grow until they find a tree trunk, then start to grow up towards the light, creeping up the tree.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstera_deliciosa#cite_note-uconn-9)
